# Landing Page Assets

This directory contains images used on the unauthenticated landing page.

## Required Images

### `enablement-hero.png`
- **Purpose**: Hero image displayed on the landing page
- **Dimensions**: Recommended 1200x600px or similar aspect ratio
- **Format**: PNG with transparent background or JPG
- **Usage**: Generic enablement-themed illustration or photo
- **Access**: Referenced as `/assets/landing/enablement-hero.png` in LandingPage.tsx

## Adding Images

1. Place image files in this directory (`apps/web/public/assets/landing/`)
2. Reference them using absolute paths: `/assets/landing/filename.png`
3. Images in `public/` are served statically and accessible at runtime

## Notes

- Images should be optimized for web (compressed, appropriate file size)
- Use local assets committed to the repo (no hotlinking)
- Ensure images are responsive and work on mobile devices
